# JAVASCRIPT BLACKJACK PROJECT
This is a series of development stages from which I will build a blackjack game from scratch, first in plain JavaScript and then in Lightning Web Components and in REACT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Building the game - *The steps*
- Build a simple game which generates random numbers for the player and the computer and awards a win or loss depending on which number is larger.
- Increase the complexity of the rules to mirror Blackjack
    - Enable hitting, busting, blackjack, holding, and a way to determine a winner.
    - Give the page a base layer of style.
    - Create functionality for a player $$ pot, and a way to draw from that amoun to make bets.
    - Substitute the random number 1 - 12 for images of of 52 card deck.
    - Update the styles and make the app look nice.
- Refactor the code from "Functional" based to "Class" based.
- Refactor the class based code for Lightning Web Components. 
    - Create LWC project and scratch org. 
    - Create components, child components, @tracks, @wires, @api decorators
    - create a package and upload it to dev hub.
- Refactor the class based code for REACT.
    - Create REACT App.
    - Manage state, redux, hooks, and mold MVC architecture from Javascript classes to REACT components.
